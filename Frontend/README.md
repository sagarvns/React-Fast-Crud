ðŸ“– Project Description
The Notes App is a simple and efficient full-stack web application that allows users to create, update, and delete notes, with data stored securely in a Microsoft SQL Server database.
Itâ€™s built using a React.js frontend for a responsive and interactive user experience, and a FastAPI backend for fast, reliable API handling. The backend uses SQLAlchemy ORM to manage database operations and PyODBC for SQL Server connectivity.
The app supports real-time note management with Axios for API communication, and CORS is enabled to ensure smooth integration between the frontend and backend during development.

This project is ideal for learning or demonstrating:

Full-stack development skills
REST API creation with FastAPI
SQL Server integration with Python
CRUD operations in a modern web app
React state management and API calls
